## 🎯 What I Learned

- Building multi-page web apps using HTML/CSS/JS  
- Managing different user roles and permissions  
- Structuring front-end code with separate JS, CSS files  
- Designing simple workflows: login, booking, dashboard

---

## 🛠 Future Improvements

- Add backend + database (Node.js, Python, etc.) for storing users & appointments persistently  
- Enable notifications (email/SMS) when appointment is booked / cancelled  
- Improve security (e.g. password hashing, input validation)  
- Make the design responsive for mobile devices  
- Add advanced features: search/filter doctors, time conflicts handling, rescheduling
